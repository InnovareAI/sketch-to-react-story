# Apollo Pricing Breakdown - Critical Cost Analysis

## 🎯 The Critical Question: Double Charging?

We're using Apollo scraper actor `jljBwyyQakqrL1wae` on Apify. Are we paying:

1. **Only Apify compute units?** (Best case)
2. **Apify CU + Apollo.io API fees?** (Likely case)  
3. **Apify CU + Apollo.io subscription?** (Worst case)

## 💰 Pricing Structure Analysis

### **Scenario A: Apify-Only Costs (Best Case)**
```
Apollo scraper actor includes Apollo.io access in CU price
- Only pay: Apify compute units (~$0.25-0.50/1000 contacts)
- Total cost: $0.25-0.50 per 1000 contacts
- Monthly 30K: $7.50-15.00
- Monthly 50K: $12.50-25.00
```

### **Scenario B: Apify + Apollo API (Most Likely)**
```
Actor owner pays Apollo.io API fees, charges premium CU rate
- Apify CU: Standard rate
- Apollo fees: Built into actor's CU consumption  
- Actor owner's markup: 50-200%
- Total cost: $1.20-2.00 per 1000 contacts (as advertised)
- Monthly 30K: $36-60
- Monthly 50K: $60-100
```

### **Scenario C: Separate Apollo Subscription (Worst Case)**
```
We need separate Apollo.io account + Apify costs
- Apollo.io plans: $39-199/month + per-contact fees
- Apify CU: Additional $0.25-0.50/1000
- Total cost: $39-199 base + $1.20-1.70/1000 contacts
- Monthly 30K: $75-250
- Monthly 50K: $99-285
```

## 🔍 **Actor Analysis: `jljBwyyQakqrL1wae`**

### **Actor Details:**
- **Name**: "🔥Apollo Scraper - Scrape upto 50k Leads"
- **Runs**: 6.3M+ (very popular)
- **Users**: 55K+ (widely adopted)
- **Description**: "Scrape up to 50,000 leads per search URL"

### **Key Indicators:**

#### **Evidence for Scenario B (Built-in Apollo Access):**
- ✅ **No mention of separate Apollo account required**
- ✅ **"Up to 50K leads per search"** suggests included access
- ✅ **High usage (6.3M runs)** indicates simple pricing
- ✅ **No complex setup docs** about Apollo credentials

#### **Evidence Against Scenario C:**
- ❌ **No input fields for Apollo API keys**
- ❌ **No documentation about Apollo subscription**
- ❌ **Too popular for complex setup requirements**

## 💡 **Most Likely Reality: Built-In Apollo Access**

Based on the actor's popularity and simplicity, **Scenario B is most likely**:

### **How It Probably Works:**
1. **Actor owner has Apollo.io enterprise account**
2. **Pays bulk Apollo API fees** (wholesale rates)
3. **Charges premium Apify CU rate** to cover costs + profit
4. **Users only pay Apify** (no separate Apollo billing)

### **Estimated Real Costs:**
```
Apollo scraper actor consumption:
- Base Apify CU: $0.25-0.50/1000 contacts
- Apollo API fees: $0.50-1.00/1000 contacts  
- Actor owner markup: $0.20-0.50/1000 contacts
- Total: $0.95-2.00/1000 contacts

Our earlier estimate of $1.20/1000 is likely accurate!
```

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy:**

### **Small Test Run (100 contacts):**
1. **Run Apollo scraper** with 100 contacts
2. **Monitor Apify billing** for actual CU consumption
3. **Check for any external charges** to Apollo.io
4. **Calculate real cost per contact**

### **Expected Results:**
```
Test: 100 contacts extraction
Expected Apify charge: $0.10-0.20
Expected Apollo charge: $0 (built into actor)
Total cost: $0.10-0.20 for 100 contacts = $1.00-2.00/1000
```

## 🎯 **Business Impact Analysis:**

### **If Built-in Apollo Access (Most Likely):**
- ✅ **No separate Apollo subscription needed**
- ✅ **Simple billing through Apify only**
- ✅ **Cost estimates accurate**: $1.20-2.00/1000
- ✅ **Enterprise volumes feasible**: 30K = $36-60, 50K = $60-100

### **If Separate Apollo Required (Unlikely):**
- ❌ **Need Apollo.io subscription**: $39-199/month base
- ❌ **Additional per-contact fees**: $0.50-1.50/1000
- ❌ **Total costs much higher**: 30K = $75-250/month
- ❌ **Business model needs adjustment**

## 🚀 **Recommended Action:**

### **Immediate:**
1. **Run small test extraction** (100 contacts)
2. **Monitor all billing sources** (Apify + any Apollo charges)
3. **Confirm actual cost structure**

### **If Built-in Access (Expected):**
- ✅ **Proceed with current pricing model**
- ✅ **$2.50-3.00/1000 client pricing** remains viable
- ✅ **Enterprise volumes ready to go**

### **If Separate Apollo Required (Unlikely):**
- 📊 **Recalculate pricing model**  
- 💰 **Adjust client rates** to cover base subscription
- 🔄 **Consider alternative actors** or direct Apollo.io integration

## 💡 **Most Probable Outcome:**

**The Apollo scraper actor almost certainly includes Apollo.io access** in its compute unit pricing. This is standard practice for popular Apify actors that integrate with external APIs.

**Our cost estimates of $1.20-2.00 per 1000 contacts are likely accurate, with no additional Apollo.io charges.**

**Let's run a small test to confirm! 🧪**
