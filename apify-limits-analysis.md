# Apify Platform Limits Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ The Real Question: Apify Infrastructure Limits

Even though we're using the Apollo scraper (`jljBwyyQakqrL1wae`) which accesses Apollo's database instead of LinkedIn, **we're still running it on Apify's platform**. So Apify's limits still apply!

## ðŸ“Š Apify Platform Limits (Current Plan: STARTER - $49/month)

### **Compute Unit (CU) Limits:**
```
STARTER Plan: $49/month
- Compute Units: $5 included + $0.25 per additional CU
- Memory: Up to 4GB per actor run
- Runtime: Up to 24 hours per run
- Concurrent runs: Up to 10 parallel actors
```

### **API Rate Limits:**
```
- API requests: 30 requests/second per resource
- Actor starts: No specific limit mentioned
- Dataset operations: 30 requests/second
- Key-value store: 30 requests/second
```

### **Data Transfer Limits:**
```
- No explicit bandwidth limits mentioned
- Charged based on compute units used
- Proxy usage included in CU costs
```

## ðŸ’° Cost Structure Analysis

### **Apollo Scraper CU Consumption (Estimated):**

Based on Apify's typical consumption patterns:

```
Small extraction (100 contacts):
- Estimated: 0.1-0.2 CU
- Cost: $0.025-0.05
- Time: 1-2 minutes

Medium extraction (1,000 contacts):
- Estimated: 1-2 CU  
- Cost: $0.25-0.50
- Time: 5-10 minutes

Large extraction (10,000 contacts):
- Estimated: 10-20 CU
- Cost: $2.50-5.00
- Time: 30-60 minutes

Enterprise extraction (50,000 contacts):
- Estimated: 50-100 CU
- Cost: $12.50-25.00
- Time: 2-4 hours
```

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Limit Discovery:**

### **The $1.20/1000 Promise vs Reality:**

Our analysis showed Apollo scraper costs $1.20 per 1000 contacts, but this might be **just the Apollo database access fee**. The **total cost** includes:

1. **Apollo database fee**: $1.20/1000 (paid to actor owner)
2. **Apify compute units**: $0.25-0.50/1000 (paid to Apify)
3. **Total real cost**: ~$1.45-1.70/1000 contacts

### **Enterprise Volume Reality Check:**

```
30,000 contacts/month:
- Apollo fees: $36.00
- Apify CU costs: $7.50-15.00  
- Total: $43.50-51.00/month

50,000 contacts/month:
- Apollo fees: $60.00
- Apify CU costs: $12.50-25.00
- Total: $72.50-85.00/month
```

## âš¡ **Operational Limits:**

### **Daily Processing Capacity:**
```
STARTER Plan Constraints:
- 10 concurrent runs maximum
- Each run: up to 24 hours
- Memory: 4GB per run
- CPU: Shared infrastructure

Realistic Daily Capacity:
- Small runs (100 contacts): 100+ runs/day
- Medium runs (1,000 contacts): 50-100 runs/day  
- Large runs (10,000 contacts): 10-20 runs/day
- Enterprise runs (50,000): 1-2 runs/day
```

### **Monthly Volume Limits:**
```
Based on CU budget and processing time:

Conservative estimate:
- 100,000 contacts/month: Possible but expensive
- 200,000+ contacts/month: Requires TEAM plan upgrade

TEAM Plan ($499/month):
- Higher CU allowance
- Better performance guarantees
- Priority support
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Mitigation Strategies:**

### **1. Batch Optimization:**
```typescript
// Instead of one 50K extraction
await extractProspects(searchUrl, 50000); // May timeout or consume 100 CU

// Use batching approach
for (let i = 0; i < 50000; i += 5000) {
  await extractProspects(searchUrl, 5000); // 10 runs Ã— 5-10 CU each
}
```

### **2. Plan Upgrade Path:**
```
Current: STARTER ($49/month) - Good for up to 30K contacts
Upgrade: TEAM ($499/month) - Supports 100K+ contacts
Enterprise: Custom pricing for millions of contacts
```

### **3. Multi-Actor Strategy:**
```typescript
// Use multiple actor instances in parallel
const parallelExtractions = [
  extractWithActor1(searchUrl1, 10000),
  extractWithActor2(searchUrl2, 10000), 
  extractWithActor3(searchUrl3, 10000)
];
const results = await Promise.all(parallelExtractions);
```

## ðŸš€ **Revised Enterprise Recommendations:**

### **For 30K contacts/month:**
- **Current STARTER plan**: Barely sufficient
- **Real cost**: $43.50-51.00/month (not $36)
- **Processing**: 6-10 batched runs needed
- **Recommendation**: Monitor closely, prepare for TEAM upgrade

### **For 50K contacts/month:**
- **Current STARTER plan**: Likely insufficient
- **Real cost**: $72.50-85.00/month (not $60)
- **Processing**: 10-15 batched runs needed  
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade to TEAM plan ($499/month)

## ðŸ’¡ **Action Items:**

1. **Test actual CU consumption** with small Apollo extractions
2. **Monitor Apify billing** to confirm real costs
3. **Implement batching logic** for large volume requests
4. **Plan upgrade path** to TEAM plan for 50K+ volumes
5. **Set up usage alerts** to track monthly consumption

## ðŸŽ¯ **Bottom Line:**

The **Apollo scraper is still the best choice**, but Apify platform limits mean:
- **Real costs are 20-40% higher** than initially estimated
- **Large volumes require batching** or plan upgrades
- **STARTER plan works for 30K/month** but is tight for 50K/month
- **Enterprise volumes (100K+) need TEAM plan** at $499/month

**The system architecture is sound, but budget planning needs adjustment for Apify infrastructure costs.**
