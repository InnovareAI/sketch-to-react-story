# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DATABASE FIX: RLS Infinite Recursion

## Issue
`infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`

## Root Cause
The `profiles_workspace_access` policy was creating recursive queries by referencing the profiles table from within itself, causing infinite loops during authentication.

## Fix Applied (FINAL)
1. **Disabled RLS temporarily** to stop infinite recursion immediately
2. **Dropped ALL problematic policies** on profiles table
3. **Created simple, safe policy**: `profiles_own_only` 
   - Only allows users to see their own profile record
   - No workspace sharing to avoid any potential recursion
4. **Re-enabled RLS** with safe policy

## SQL Commands Executed
```sql
-- Disable RLS to stop recursion
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all potentially problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS profiles_workspace_access ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS profiles_select_own_workspace ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Create profile on signup" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Update own profile" ON profiles;

-- Create safe, non-recursive policy
CREATE POLICY profiles_own_only ON profiles 
FOR ALL 
USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Re-enable RLS with safe policy
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Impact & Resolution
- âœ… **Infinite recursion completely eliminated**
- âœ… **Authentication working for CL/CS accounts**
- âœ… **Campaign saving functional** - workspace errors resolved
- âœ… **Inbox restored and accessible** in navigation
- âœ… **Database queries execute normally** without recursion

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
- **Applied**: Thu Aug 15 16:35:00 PST 2025
- **Tested**: All profiles queries work without recursion
- **Verified**: CL and CS accounts can authenticate and access workspace data

## Notes
- The fix prioritizes stability over cross-workspace visibility
- Users can only see their own profile records (no team member sharing)
- This prevents ANY possibility of recursive queries
- Future enhancement can add workspace sharing with careful non-recursive design

*This was a critical production issue that completely blocked user authentication. The fix has been applied directly to the database and is effective immediately.*
