## 🛡️ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Why You Need 2FA

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring:
1. **Something you know** (your password)
2. **Something you have** (your phone with authenticator app)

This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

### Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

#### Step 1: Navigate to Security Settings
```
Workspace Settings → Security Tab → Two-Factor Authentication
```

#### Step 2: Install an Authenticator App

Recommended apps:
- **Google Authenticator** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2))
- **Microsoft Authenticator** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator))
- **Authy** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/authy/id494168017) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy))

#### Step 3: Scan QR Code
1. Click **"Enable Two-Factor Authentication"**
2. Open your authenticator app
3. Tap **"Add Account"** or **"+"**
4. Select **"Scan QR Code"**
5. Point your camera at the QR code on screen

#### Step 4: Verify Setup
1. Enter the 6-digit code from your app
2. Click **"Verify and Enable"**
3. **IMPORTANT**: Save your backup codes!

### 💾 Backup Codes

**What are backup codes?**
- One-time use codes for emergency access
- Use when you can't access your authenticator app
- Each code works only once

**How to store them safely:**
- ✅ Password manager (recommended)
- ✅ Printed and stored in a safe
- ✅ Encrypted file on secure cloud storage
- ❌ Email (not secure)
- ❌ Plain text file on computer
- ❌ Screenshot on phone

---

## 🔑 Password Security

### Creating a Strong Password

#### Password Requirements
- **Minimum 12 characters** (16+ recommended)
- **Mix of characters**: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Unique**: Not used on any other website
- **No personal information**: No names, birthdays, addresses

#### Good Password Examples
```
✅ Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-2024!
✅ MyL!nk3d1n@cc0unt$ecur3
✅ 7*Purple#Monkey$Dishwasher
```

#### Bad Password Examples
```
❌ password123
❌ linkedin2024
❌ YourName2024
❌ Company@123
```

### Password Manager Recommendations

Using a password manager is the best way to maintain unique, strong passwords:

1. **1Password** - Best for teams
2. **Bitwarden** - Best free option
3. **LastPass** - Good for business
4. **Dashlane** - Best for individuals

## 🔗 Managing LinkedIn Connections

### Before Connecting LinkedIn

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] 2FA enabled on SAM AI account
- [ ] 2FA enabled on LinkedIn account
- [ ] Review requested permissions
- [ ] Understand data access scope

### Understanding OAuth Permissions

When you connect LinkedIn, you grant these permissions:

| Permission | What It Means | Risk Level |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Basic Profile** | View your name, photo, headline | Low |
| **Email Address** | Access your primary email | Low |
| **Share Content** | Post updates on your behalf | Medium |
| **Send Messages** | Send connection requests and messages | High |

### Revoking Access

If you need to disconnect LinkedIn:

1. **From SAM AI:**
   ```
   Settings → LinkedIn → Disconnect Account
   ```

2. **From LinkedIn:**
   ```
   LinkedIn Settings → Data Privacy → 
   Permitted Services → SAM AI → Remove
   ```

### Signs of Compromised Account

**Watch for:**
- 🚨 Unexpected connection requests sent
- 🚨 Messages you didn't write
- 🚨 Profile changes you didn't make
- 🚨 Login notifications from unknown locations

**If compromised:**
1. Immediately disconnect LinkedIn in SAM AI
2. Change your LinkedIn password
3. Review LinkedIn security settings
4. Contact support@samai.com

## 👥 Team Access Management

### For Workspace Managers

#### Setting Up Team 2FA Policy

1. **Navigate to Security Settings**
   ```
   Workspace Settings → Security → Workspace 2FA Policy
   ```

2. **Choose Enforcement Level**
   - **Optional**: Recommended but not required
   - **Required**: All users must enable 2FA
   - **Role-Based**: Specific roles require 2FA

3. **Set Grace Period**
   - Give users time to set up 2FA (1-30 days)
   - Send automatic reminders
   - Block access after grace period

#### Regular Access Audits

**Monthly Tasks:**
- [ ] Review all team members
- [ ] Remove inactive users
- [ ] Check role assignments

**How to audit:**
```
Workspace Settings → Team → Review Members
```

Look for:
- Users who haven't logged in for 30+ days

- External collaborators who no longer need access

### For Team Members

#### Your Security Responsibilities

1. **Protect Your Credentials**
   - Never share your password
