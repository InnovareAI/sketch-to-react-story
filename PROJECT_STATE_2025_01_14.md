**Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/InnovareAI/sketch-to-react-story  
**Live URL:** https://sameaisalesassistant.netlify.app

## 🎯 Project Overview

SAM AI is an MCP-first orchestration platform with dual interfaces:
- **SAM Agent Workspace**: Conversational interface for LinkedIn owners (experience-focused)
- **React Workspace**: Direct UI for campaign teams (efficiency-focused)

## 🏗️ Architecture Understanding

### Core Platform Components
```
SAM AI Ecosystem:
├── 🤖 SAM Orchestration Agent (main coordinator)
├── 🔄 SAM Reply Agent (auto-responses)
├── 📈 SAM Follow-up Agent (conversation management)
├── 🕷️ Apify API (data extraction & enrichment)
├── 🗄️ Supabase RAG (knowledge base & vector search)
├── 🔌 Unipile API (LinkedIn messaging execution)
├── 📧 ReachInbox API (email broadcasts)
└── ⚙️ N8N Infrastructure (workflow orchestration)
```

### User Persona Split
**Campaign Teams (React Workspace):**
- Marketing managers, agencies, power users
- Need: Speed, efficiency, bulk operations, detailed analytics
- Usage: Set up 10+ campaigns daily, bulk CSV uploads, A/B testing

**LinkedIn Owners (SAM Agent Workspace):**
- Sales reps, business owners, entrepreneurs
- Need: Simplicity, experience, "just handle it for me"
- Usage: Conversational requests, full automation, results focus

## 🚀 Recent Completed Work

## 📋 Outstanding Tasks & Roadmap

### 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY - Backend Architecture

#### 1. Dynamic N8N Workflow Generation
**Status:** Not Started  
**Files to Create:**
```
src/services/campaign/
├── DynamicWorkflowBuilder.ts     # Convert UI campaigns → N8N workflows
├── CampaignExecutor.ts           # Manage workflow lifecycle
├── CredentialManager.ts          # Auto-inject user credentials
└── index.ts                      # Main service API
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Generate N8N workflows from React UI campaign configurations
- Handle variable number of steps (no templates needed)
- Auto-inject Unipile credentials for seamless execution
- Support different campaign types (connection, message, follow-up)

#### 2. Campaign Intelligence Service  
**Status:** Not Started  
**File:** `src/services/CampaignIntelligenceService.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- **Apify Integration**: Enrich contact data (LinkedIn profiles, company info)
- **Supabase RAG**: Build knowledge context for campaigns
- **Data Storage**: Store enriched data in vector database
- **Context Generation**: Create campaign-specific knowledge bases

#### 3. SAM Agent Integration Service
**Status:** Not Started  
**File:** `src/services/SAMAgentIntegration.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- **Reply Detection**: Connect to SAM Reply Agent
- **Follow-up Automation**: Integration with SAM Follow-up Agent  
- **Context Sharing**: Provide campaign context to SAM agents
- **Conversation Handoff**: Seamless human-to-agent transitions

### 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY - MCP Infrastructure

#### 4. SAM MCP Tools for Campaign Management
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Files to Create:**
```
src/mcp/
├── campaignTools.ts              # MCP tools for SAM
├── prospectTools.ts              # Apify integration tools  
├── workflowTools.ts              # N8N management tools
└── monitoringTools.ts            # Campaign tracking tools
```

**MCP Tools Needed:**
- `apify_prospect_search` - Find LinkedIn prospects
- `supabase_knowledge_query` - RAG queries
- `n8n_create_workflow` - Dynamic workflow creation
- `unipile_send_message` - LinkedIn messaging
- `campaign_monitor` - Real-time campaign stats

#### 5. Conversational Campaign Interface
**Status:** Design Phase  
**Integration:** SAM Agent Workspace

**User Experience Flow:**
```
User: "Find me 50 SaaS CTOs and send a 2-step sequence"
SAM: "I'll handle that. Creating campaign now..."
[Auto-executes full pipeline]
SAM: "Campaign launched! 50 CTOs contacted. I'll notify you of replies."
```

### 🎯 LOW PRIORITY - UI Enhancements

**File:** `src/components/campaigns/CampaignSetupFlow.tsx`

**Potential Improvements:**
- Drag-and-drop step reordering
- Message template library
- A/B testing configuration
- Advanced scheduling options
- Team collaboration features

#### 7. Real-time Campaign Monitoring

└── sam_conversations - Agent interaction logs
```

## 💡 Architecture Decisions Made

### ✅ Confirmed Approaches
1. **Dual Interface Strategy**: React Workspace + SAM Agent Workspace
2. **N8N for Orchestration**: Dynamic workflow generation vs static templates  
3. **MCP-First Design**: SAM as primary interface for LinkedIn owners
4. **Shared Backend**: Same services power both interfaces
5. **Apify for Data**: LinkedIn prospect enrichment and validation
6. **Supabase RAG**: Knowledge base for intelligent responses

### 🤔 Open Questions  
1. **N8N Workflow Limits**: Max nodes per workflow, concurrent executions
2. **Apify Rate Limits**: How many prospects can we process simultaneously
3. **Supabase Vector Limits**: Storage and query performance at scale
4. **SAM Agent Response Time**: Balancing intelligence vs speed
5. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: How to isolate campaigns between workspaces

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

### Campaign Teams (React Workspace)
- Time to create campaign (target: <5 minutes)
- Bulk operation speed (1000+ prospects in <30 seconds)  
- Campaign setup success rate
- Feature adoption (advanced vs basic features)

### LinkedIn Owners (SAM Agent)
- Conversation completion rate
- Time from request to campaign launch
- User satisfaction with automated results
- Repeat usage patterns

### Platform Performance
- N8N workflow execution success rate
- Apify data enrichment accuracy
- Unipile message delivery rates
- SAM agent response relevance

## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

1. **Start with DynamicWorkflowBuilder** - Core N8N integration
2. **Apify Integration** - Prospect data enrichment  
3. **Test End-to-End Flow** - React UI → N8N → Unipile
4. **SAM MCP Tools** - Begin conversational interface

**Current Status:** ✅ Frontend complete, backend architecture designed, ready for integration development

**Key Insight:** Platform serves two distinct user types with different needs - campaign efficiency vs user experience. Architecture accommodates both through shared backend with dual interfaces.
