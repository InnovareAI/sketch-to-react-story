// Parallel Processing
Complex Request → Orchestrator → Multiple Specialists (parallel) → Response Aggregation → Synthesized Response
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Agent-Level**: Graceful fallbacks within each specialist
2. **Orchestrator-Level**: Alternative agent routing if primary fails
3. **System-Level**: Fallback to simplified mode if multi-agent system fails
4. **User-Level**: Clear error communication with alternative actions

### Performance Monitoring
- Agent processing times and success rates
- Intent classification accuracy
