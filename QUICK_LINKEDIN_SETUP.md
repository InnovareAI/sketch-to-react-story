## Option 3: Use Apify LinkedIn Scraper
Already in your MCP servers

## Option 4: Manual LinkedIn App (Free but Complex)

2. Create app (requires company page)
3. Get Client ID & Secret (NOT your email/password)
4. Configure OAuth redirect URLs

## What Client ID/Secret Actually Are:

- **Client ID**: Public identifier for your app (like `78h5r3mkw6xfvs`)
- **Client Secret**: Private key for your app (like `WPL_AP1.xyz...`)
- **NOT**: Your LinkedIn email or password
- **Purpose**: Allows your app to request permission from users

## Current Status

Your app is in demo mode. To connect real LinkedIn accounts, you need one of the above options.

The easiest is Phantombuster or RapidAPI since they don't require OAuth setup.
